# Gaussian Mixture
## [Detailed Project](https://nbviewer.org/github/davidefilosa/GaussianMixture/blob/master/Gaussian%20Mixture%20%28Clustering%29%20.ipynb)


## What will we do in this project?

In this project we are going to segment different countries based on socio-economic aspects.

As a model for the segmentation we will use the **Gaussian Mixture**.

A mixture model is a probabilistic model to represent the presence of subpopulations within the overall population, but it does not require that the observed data already identify which subpopulation each individual belongs to.

The Gaussian Mixture is a **probabilistic** method and its advantage is that once clusters have been identified in which to divide the population, **it will tell us the probability of each individual belonging to each subpopulation. The probability will help to evaluate better edge cases.**
